"""Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.There are still many devices around that are limited to 80 characterlines; plus, limiting windows to 80 characters makes it possible to have
several windows side-by-side. The default wrapping on such devices looks
ugly. Therefore, please limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
For flowing long blocks of text (docstrings or comments), limiting the
length to 72 characters is recommended.
Reports error E501.
